{title:Description}

{p}{cmd: importCodebook} imports data from one or more spreadsheets and datasets and appends and consolidates them based on a single metadata spreadsheet containing information about the variables.

{synopt:{opt p:rep}}Creates a metadata template spreadsheet at the specified {help using} location containing the correct variable names from the master files. {p_end}

{synopt:{opt name:row(#)}}Do not include this option if you wish to use column letters as variable names.

Variable names will automatically be included from a .dta master.{p_end}{break}
{synopt: {opt head:row(#)}}Indicate the row in the master spreadsheets which contains data labels to prefill in the metadata sheet. Exclude this option to use the variable names as the prefilled labels. Variable labels will automatically be included from a .dta master.{p_end}{break}
{synopt:{opt sheet()}}Optionally indicate the names of the sheet on which data is located (one for each spreadsheet, in order; you must include an "x" for .dta files).{p_end}{break}

Otherwise, indicate the row number of the master spreadsheets containing original variable names; this must me consistent across all spreadsheets.

{synopt:{opt head:row(#)}}Indicate the last header row before data begins. If not specified, all rows are treated as data.{p_end}{break}

{synopt:{opt drop:col(letter)}}Indicate a column which, if empty, means that the row is not an observation. This avoids importing a large number of blank rows. If not specified, observations are dropped if column A is blank.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt old:name(names)}}Indicate the column name(s) containing the original variable names to match to the master files, in order. By default these will be oldname_1 for the first master file, oldname_2 for the second master file, and so on; these must be specified manually and if they are changed in metadata must be changed in the command.{p_end}{break}
{synopt:{opt rec:ode(names)}}Indicate the column name(s) containing the recode codes (STATA syntax), in the same order as the master files. By default there is only one recode column in metadata ("Recode"); if different recodes are needed for different master files these columns must be added and specified in the command.{p_end}

{synopt:}{p_end}
{synopt:{opt i:ndex(varname)}}Indicate a new variable name to identify the source of each observation. It will be given the values 1 2 3... in the order of the masters and can be coded in the metadata.{p_end}{break}
{synopt:{opt a:ppend}}Reads the {it:first} master file (assumed to already be a constructed dataset) for the highest already existing data of the variable name indicated in {opt i:ndex()} and begins index numbering from the next value, without replacing values in first master.{p_end}{break}
{synopt:{opt dem:erge()}}For the final-named variables specified, missing data is treated as vertically merged cells and any empty value is filled with the preceding values to "de-merge" the vertically merged Excel data.{p_end}

{title:Instructions}

{p}{bf:import_metadata} imports any mix of master Excel and .dta files, recodes and labels them according to a common metadata spreadsheet, and appends them, leaving the result in active memory. Master Excel data file(s) to be imported may have a name for each column variable, according to the {bf:namerow()}, or use the column letter. There should be no other rows with entries once the data has begun (except those excluded by dropcol() if necessary), and the final row of the header (the last row before data begins, including names and labels) should be consistent across all master Excel files and indicated with the {bf:headrow()} option.{p_end}

{p}The Excel metadata file must have a {it:row} for every variable in its first sheet, "Codebook". The columns should indicate:{p_end}
 
{p 2 5}{bf:1)} The "original" name of the variable that matches the master file, corresponding to {bf:oldname()}. These must match the names in the master files {it:after} they are converted to STATA names by {help strtoname}. To obtain this list in a template metadata file, use the {cmd:prep} option. These names may vary across masters; to consolidate naming conflicts, place the variables in the same row and specify a single new name in the column titled {it:Variable Name}. In all cases, one {bf:oldname()} column must be specified for each master file, in order. Columns may be reused for multiple masters.{p_end}
{break}
{p 2 5}{bf:2)} The final name for the variable in {it:Variable Name}.{p_end}
{break}
{p 2 5}{bf:3)} Any necessary variable labels for the variable in {it:Variable Label}.{p_end}
{break}
{p 2 5}{bf:4)} A {bf:recode()} for the variable to be applied {bf:before} value labels. As in the original names, there must be one such entry for each master file even if no recodes are to occur for that master. Names can be repeated.{p_end}
{break}
{p 2 5}{bf:5)} Any necessary value label for the variable in {it:Value Label} (see below).{p_end}
{break}
{p 2 5}{bf:6)} The list of filenames in which that variable belongs in {it:file}.{p_end}
{break}		
{p}The Excel metadata file will also have a {it:Value Label} sheet with a {it:row} for every value of every value label to be applied. The column entries {bf:must} indicate:{p_end}

{p 2 5}{bf:1)} The name of the value label (corresponding to the value labels in the first sheet) in {it:Value Label}.{p_end}
{p 2 5}{bf:2)} The value (unique within label; numeric) in {it:Value}.{p_end}
{p 2 5}{bf:3)} The label for the value in {it:Label}.{p_end}

{p}The Excel metadata file will also have a {it:construct} sheet with a {it:row} for every command to be executed, before variable labelling. This is an experimental feature and is not guaranteed. The column entries {bf:must} indicate:{p_end}

{p 2 5}{bf:1)} The command in {it:command}.{p_end}
{p 2 5}{bf:2)} The variable name when relevant in {it:varname}. For the commands {help generate} and {help egen}, the variables will be dropped from existing data and regenerated consistently for all data. This is primarily relevant when {opt a:ppend} is specified.{p_end}
{p 2 5}{bf:3)} The required arguments or expression in {it:expression}. Omit the = sign for {help generate}, {help egen}, and {help replace}.{p_end}
